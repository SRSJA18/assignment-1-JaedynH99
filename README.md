# Assignment1
First assignment for Introduction to Python

This assignment will help you become familiar with the basics of writing programs in Python.

## Problem 1

Hello, World! again. 

## Problem 2

Use print statements to output a tic-tac-toe board. Nothing difficult here, try to replicate it exactly. You can use cut and paste inside of PyCharm.

## Problem 3

Problem 3 introduces variables to hold text (we computer scientists like to call these strings) and demonstrates how using variables can simplify the program from problem 2.

**Extension: Repeating Lyrics**

Need more of a challenge or want to do your own creative work? This task will let you choose your own path.

## Problem 4

Back to variables and math. Part 2 of this assignment requires special math symbols so they are available in either a separate PDF document or a separate markdown document. 

## Problem 5

We finish up this assignment by learning about how to get input from the user. Pay careful attention to the difference between input and raw_input.
